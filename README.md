> \[!IMPORTANT]
> If you didnâ€™t set a static IP during install of Debian, I highly recommend you do that **before** running the installer.
> See [this guide](https://github.com/dbqrs/asl3/wiki/Configure-a-Static-IP-Address-in-Debian-12-Linux) for an easy how to.

> \[!WARNING]
> Review the installer script before running it: [https://asl.dbqrs.com](https://asl.dbqrs.com)

> \[!NOTE]
> This script installs AllStarlink 3, Allmon 3, Cockpit, Sudo, and required dependencies. It automates the creation of a self-signed SSL certificate to enable HTTPS, valid for 10 years. It adds necessary system paths and creates a logfile located at /var/log/asl3_setup.log

## Configure a Static IP Address in Debian 12 Linux

This guide walks you through changing the network configuration from DHCP to a static IP.

### 1) Open the network configuration file

```bash
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

### 2) Find the current configuration

```ini
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

### 3) Change DHCP to static

Replace with the following (adjust for your network):

```ini
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.55
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
```

> \[!NOTE]
> Your interface name might not be `eth0`. It could be something like `enp0s3` or `ens33`.
> Replace `eth0` with your actual interface name.

### 4) Save and exit nano

* Press `CTRL+X` to begin saving.
* Press `Y` to confirm changes.
* Press `Enter` to write the file and exit.

### 5) Restart the networking service

```bash
systemctl restart networking
```

### 6) Verify the IP address

```bash
ip addr
```

Look for your configured IP (e.g., `192.168.1.55`).
